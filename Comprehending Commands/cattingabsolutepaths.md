## Catting absolute paths

### My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{EgSPvkIlVVnY8SIpFe9xO8RSLku.QX5ETO0wiN3EzNzEzW}

hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag

I read it with cat at its absolute path: /flag.

### New Learnings
/flag is where the flag always lives in pwn.college and i use the cat command to read it.
