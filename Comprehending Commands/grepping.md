Challenge 4
## Grepping for a needle in a haystack

### My solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{Au2c8MnjMPCa2C0cJ0oKtHDbg6W.QX3EDO0wiN3EzNzEzW}

hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt

I used the grep command to search the contents for the file /chalenge/data.txt

### New Learnings
I learnt that the flag always starts with the text pwn.college. Sometimes, the files that you might cat out are too big and hence the grep command can be used.
