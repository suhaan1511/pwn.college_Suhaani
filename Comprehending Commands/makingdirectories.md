Challenge 12
## Making directories

### My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{MRuyvA1TjxU7BQzDAIsyQg6Eyho.QXxMDO0wiN3EzNzEzW}

hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ touch /tmp/pwn/college
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ /challenge/run
Success!

I made the /tmp/pwn directory using the mkdir command and then i made college file inside it and ran it to get the flag.
