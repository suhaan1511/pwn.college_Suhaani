Challenge 3
## More Catting Practice

### My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{UD6MRAdztf8uEmsJo32Zm0YjRbe.QXwITO0wiN3EzNzEzW}

You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by 
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it 
in the file /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding 
into that directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/flag

### New learnings
Here I retrieved the flag by absolute path without changing directories with cd.
