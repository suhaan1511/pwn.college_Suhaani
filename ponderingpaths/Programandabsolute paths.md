Challenge 2
## Program and absolute paths

**Flag:** pwn.college{IXP_lDCvYTbwMwOSzvnf1gC_5Yg.QX1QTN0wiN3EzNzEzW}

### My Solve
hacker@pathsprogram-and-absolute-paths:$ /challenge/run
Correct!!! /challenge/run is an absolute path! 

The challenges in pwn.college are in the challenge directory and the challenge directory is, in turn, right in the root directory (/). 
The path to the challenge directory is, thus, /challenge. 
The name of the challenge program in this level is run, and it lives in the /challenge directory.
Thus, the path to the run challenge program is /challenge/run. I executed it by invoking its absolute path. 

### New Learnings
I learned that challenges are in the challenge directory and the challenge directory is, in turn, right in the root directory (/). 
I learned that run is the name of the challenge program and the path is /challenge/run.
